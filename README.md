# Sentiment-Analysis-Project

This was the group project for CSE 353: Machine Learning, developed in a team consisting of myself, William Murdy, and Alexander Tairbekov.

We implemented sentiment analysis on a large dataset of Rotten Tomatoes movie reviews using a naive bayes classifier. More information (and graphs, yay!) can be found in the <i>ProjectReport.pdf</i> and <i>Final Presentation.pdf</i>.

Summary of the other files:
* <i>Classifier.py</i> - Runs the entire project, starting with cleaning the data set of reviews
* <i>NaiveBayes.py</i> - Our implementation of the Naive Bayes classifier
* <i>knn.py</i> - Beginning of the implementation of the k-Nearest Neighbors classifier
* Various <i>.tsv</i> and <i>.csv</i> files - test and training data files
