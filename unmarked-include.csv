8760	An atonal estrogen opera that demonizes feminism while gifting the most sympathetic male of the piece with a nice vomit bath at his wedding .	0
8761	For me , this opera is n't a favorite , so it 's a long time before the fat lady sings .	1
8762	Thrilling , provocative and darkly funny , this timely sci-fi mystery works on so many different levels that it not only invites , it demands repeated viewings .	4

8768	The movie 's eventual success should be credited to Dennis Quaid , in fighting trim shape as an athlete as well as an actor	2
8769	The movie sticks much closer to Hornby 's drop-dead confessional tone than the film version of High Fidelity did .	2
8770	The film flat lines when it should peak and is more missed opportunity and trifle than dark , decadent truffle .	1
8771	De Niro and McDormand give solid performances , but their screen time is sabotaged by the story 's inability to create interest .	2

8773	A quietly reflective and melancholy New Zealand film about an eventful summer in a 13-year-old girl 's life .	3
8774	A long-winded and stagy session of romantic contrivances that never really gels like the shrewd feminist fairy tale it could have been .	1

8776	At times , however , Dogtown and Z-Boys lapses into an insider 's lingo and mindset that the uninitiated may find hard to follow , or care about .	1

8789	Morrissette 's script and direction show a fair amount of intelligence and wit -- but it does n't signify a whole lot either .	2
8790	Superior genre storytelling , which gets under our skin simply by crossing the nuclear line .	4
8791	Cry havoc and let slip the dogs of cheese , indeed .	2
8792	Forgettable horror -- more gory than psychological -- with a highly satisfying quotient of Friday-night excitement and Milla power .	2
8793	Windtalkers celebrates the human spirit and packs an emotional wallop .	3
8794	A giggle a minute .	3

8804	The film often achieves a mesmerizing poetry .	4
8805	Tadpole is a sophisticated , funny and good-natured treat , slight but a pleasure .	3
8806	It 's a terrific American sports movie and Dennis Quaid is its athletic heart .	3
8807	It 's amazingly perceptive in its subtle , supportive but unsentimental look at the Marks family .	3
8808	if you are an actor who can relate to the search for inner peace by dramatically depicting the lives of others onstage , then Esther 's story is a compelling quest for truth .	2
8809	A clutchy , indulgent and pretentious travelogue and diatribe against ... well , just stuff .	1
8810	While the Resident Evil games may have set new standards for thrills , suspense , and gore for video games , the movie really only succeeds in the third of these .	1
8811	To say this was done better in Wilder 's Some Like It Hot is like saying the sun rises in the east .	3
8812	The Wild Thornberrys Movie is a jolly surprise .	3

8814	A great ensemble cast ca n't lift this heartfelt enterprise out of the familiar .	1
8815	Even the unwatchable Soapdish is more original .	0

8822	This formulaic chiller will do little to boost Stallone 's career .	1
8823	-LRB- Villeneuve -RRB- seems to realize intuitively that even morality is reduced to an option by the ultimate mysteries of life and death .	2

8825	No movement , no yuks , not much of anything .	0
8826	Having had the good sense to cast actors who are , generally speaking , adored by the movie-going public , Khouri then gets terrific performances from them all .	3

8843	The movie is for fans who ca n't stop loving anime , and the fanatical excess built into it .	1
8844	A fast , funny , highly enjoyable movie .	4
